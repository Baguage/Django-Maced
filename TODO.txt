Add permission checking.
Add duplication action.
Add info action.
Refactor the url stuff so that you only need one url per item. It should be easy to do by simply passing item ids through the data in the ajax.
Make item_html_name an optional parameter that defaults to a prettified version of the item_name. "abc" to "Abc", "abc_def" to "Abc Def".
Add check for if an item was added to the context but not added to the template and if this is true, alert so it is obvious.
Change the way the the merge works such that the merge button is always available (with at least 2 items in the system), and you can select on both sides of the merge, instead of just the right side.
Add functionality for recursive maced items.
Convert action views into a class based view so that it can be easily overridden by users for custom views. This might be hard since you would have to follow strict rules on what to send back through the ajax calls.
